The claw machine
Use The keyboard control claws to grab the toy you want

Summary
In this project, I would like to make a claw machine by p5.js Web Editor.
I would like to set some “toys” in the claw machine and the player could move the claw by “←” and “→”. While they decided the toy they want, player could press space key to catch it. If the play can catch the toy successful, the machine will play a short music of victory.
